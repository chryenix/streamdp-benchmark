# Benchmarking the Utility of $w$-event Differential Privacy Mechanisms -- When Baselines Become Mighty Competitors
This code corresponds to the paper: Sch채ler, C., H체tter, T., & Sch채ler, M. (2023). Benchmarking the Utility of w-Event Differential Privacy Mechanisms-When Baselines Become Mighty Competitors. Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 16(8), 1830-1842.


## Software requirements

The following list of software is required to execute the experiments:
  * bash
  * python 3
  * curl
  * java jdk
  * java jre
  * docker
  * excel (for ploting)


## Reproduce the experiments

We provide a convenience script to perform the experiments and plot the results shown in Sch채ler et al. (2023). Note that we assume that all datasets are stored in `./data`. However, due to conflicting licenses, we are not allowed to share the experimental data publicly. The convenience script is executed from the root directory of the repository as follows:
```
sh scripts/perform-experiment.sh
```

Further note that the experiments take approximately 24 hours to complete. The plots can be reproduced by copying the results from `./results` in the excel file in `./figures/vldb-reproducibility.xlsx`.
